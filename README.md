## Things to note
- All development will be done in GDScript and C++. GDScript will be used for nearly everything aside from very technical things that need to run fast; e.g. enemy targeting algorithms.

## Requirements
- Godot Engine 4.1.1
- C++ Compiler installed; click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) for a guide with VS Code.
- Inside Godot Engine, set the renderer to 'Mobile' if it wasn't done so already.
